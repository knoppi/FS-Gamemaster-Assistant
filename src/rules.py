        Set the current stance.

        :param int new_stance: Index of the chosen stance.

        A character can choose between four stances identified by their index:

        0 - NEUTRAL STANCE
            By default most characters are in a neutral stance which ofers no
            bonus or penalties. Surprised characters are assumed to be in a
            neutral stance.
        1 - AGGRESSIVE STANCE
            A character taking an aggressive stance is acting with out regard
            to safety. The character sacrifices defense to increase the chances
            of success. Taking an aggressive stance lowers a character’s Defense
            by 2. When taking an aggressive stance the player can choose to gain
            a +4 bonus to goal numbers or add 2 damage efect dice to any
            successful attack. When ighting with an aggressive stance a
            character cannot pull VP to try and slip under shields. All VP must
            be converted to wounds.
        2 - DEFENSIVE STANCE
            Sometimes a character wants to live more than they want to deal
            damage. Characters taking a defensive stance are keeping their head
            down, ducking and covering, and concentrating on staying out of the
            line of ire. A character in a defensive stance gains +2 Defense, but
            takes a –4 penalty to all goal numbers until their next action.
        3 - FULL DEFENSE STANCE
            Sometimes a character may want to cover up so that they can move
            across a battleield quickly. Other times they may want to hide in a
            hole and hope no one attacks them. A character can declare full
            defense before Initiative and get +4 Defense.
            On a turn where a character declares full defense the only action
            they can take is to move (move, run, or stand/kneel/prone). If they
            choose to run they still lose 2 Defense for running.
